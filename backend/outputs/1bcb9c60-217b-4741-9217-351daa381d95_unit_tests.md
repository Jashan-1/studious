# Unit Test Questions

## Question 1
When her son dies, Kisa Gotami goes from house to house. What does she ask for? Does she get it? Why not?

**Model Answer:**
Kisa Gotami asks for medicine to cure her dead son when she goes from house to house. She does not receive it because the people she encounters recognize that her son is dead and cannot be saved, and they ultimately believe that she has lost her senses in her grief.

**Key Points:**
- Kisa Gotami's request for medicine signifies her denial of reality.
- The townspeople's responses highlight the finality of death.
- Her inability to obtain the medicine reflects her initial misunderstanding of grief.

## Question 2
Kisa Gotami again goes from house to house after she speaks with the Buddha. What does she ask for, the second time around? Does she get it? Why not?

**Model Answer:**
The second time, Kisa Gotami asks for mustard seeds from a household that has never experienced death. However, she is unable to find any household that meets this criterion, as every family she visits has suffered the loss of a loved one, illustrating the universality of death.

**Key Points:**
- Kisa Gotami's second request for mustard seeds demonstrates her quest for understanding.
- The failure to find suitable mustard seeds symbolizes the inevitability of grief and loss.
- Her experience reinforces the lesson about the shared nature of human suffering.

## Question 3
What does Kisa Gotami understand the second time that she failed to understand the first time? Was this what the Buddha wanted her to understand?

**Model Answer:**
The second time, Kisa Gotami understands that death is a universal experience that affects everyone, not just her. This realization aligns with the Buddha's intention to teach her that suffering and loss are common to all, encouraging her to move beyond her personal grief.

**Key Points:**
- Kisa's newfound understanding emphasizes the collective nature of suffering.
- Her initial perspective was narrow and self-focused.
- The Buddha aimed to guide her toward acceptance and compassion for others' pain.

## Question 4
Why do you think Kisa Gotami understood this only the second time? In what way did the Buddha change her understanding?

**Model Answer:**
Kisa Gotami likely understood this only after her exhaustive search for mustard seeds, which forced her to confront the reality of death in others' lives. The Buddha changed her understanding by prompting her to realize that her grief was not unique and that embracing the shared experience of loss could lead to healing and peace.

**Key Points:**
- The process of seeking mustard seeds served as a catalyst for her understanding.
- The Buddha's teachings encouraged her to see beyond her individual pain.
- This shift allowed her to cultivate empathy and acceptance of mortality.

## Question 5
How do you usually understand the idea of ‘selfishness’? Do you agree with Kisa Gotami that she was being ‘selfish in her grief’?

**Model Answer:**
Selfishness is typically understood as prioritizing one's own needs or desires over others. Kisa Gotami's realization of her selfishness in grief reflects her initial focus on her personal loss without acknowledging the shared nature of suffering. I agree with her assessment, as her grief initially blinded her to the collective sorrow experienced by others.

**Key Points:**
- Selfishness often involves a lack of awareness of others' feelings.
- Kisa's journey illustrates the importance of empathy in overcoming personal grief.
- Recognizing shared suffering can transform one's perspective on loss.
