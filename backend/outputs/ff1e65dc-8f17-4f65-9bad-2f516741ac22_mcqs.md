## Question 6
What distinguishes minerals found in veins and lodes compared to those found in beds or layers?

A. Veins and lodes form in sedimentary rocks, beds in igneous  
B. Veins and lodes are smaller and form from minerals in molten state forced upward; beds/layers result from deposition in sedimentary rocks  
C. Both form in ocean beds  
D. Beds and layers are only formed by volcanic eruptions  

**Answer:** B  
**Explanation:** Veins and lodes are formed by minerals in molten/gaseous forms forced upward in cracks, while beds/layers form in sedimentary rocks through deposition.
