**Model Answer:**
Kisa Gotami's understanding changes because the Buddha's teachings and her experiences compel her to confront the reality of death.

## Question 5
Reflect on your own understanding of 'selfishness' in relation to grief. Do you agree with Kisa Gotami's realization that she was being selfish in her grief?

**Model Answer:**
Selfishness in grief can mean focusing solely on one’s pain without recognizing that others share similar experiences. I agree with Kisa Gotami's realization, as her initial inability to see beyond her own sorrow prevented her from understanding the collective nature of grief. Acknowledging shared suffering can lead to healing and compassion.

**Key Points:**
- Selfishness in grief may involve isolation in one's sorrow.
- Kisa Gotami learns to recognize shared human experiences.
- Understanding collective grief can foster empathy and healing.
