# Unit Test Questions

## Question 1
When her son dies, Kisa Gotami goes from house to house. What does she ask for? Does she get it? Why not?

**Model Answer:**  
Kisa Gotami asks for mustard seeds to cure her dead son, believing that obtaining them will bring him back to life. However, she does not get the mustard seeds because every household she visits has experienced the loss of a loved one, illustrating the universal nature of death and grief.

**Key Points:**
- Kisa Gotami's request for mustard seeds.
- Her belief that it will bring her son back.
- The realization that every household has experienced loss.

## Question 2
Kisa Gotami again goes from house to house after she speaks with the Buddha. What does she ask for, the second time around? Does she get it? Why not?

**Model Answer:**  
The second time, Kisa Gotami asks for mustard seeds again, but this time she understands that they must come from a house that has not known death. She does not get the seeds because she realizes that every family has faced loss, leading her to comprehend that her grief is not unique.

**Key Points:**
- Kisa's second request for mustard seeds.
- The condition that they must come from a household untouched by death.
- Her realization of the universality of grief.

## Question 3
What does Kisa Gotami understand the second time that she failed to understand the first time? Was this what the Buddha wanted her to understand?

**Model Answer:**  
The second time, Kisa Gotami understands that death is a common experience shared by all people, and that her grief is not isolated. This realization aligns with what the Buddha wanted her to learn — that accepting the universality of suffering can lead to healing and peace.

**Key Points:**
- Kisa's recognition of the universality of death.
- The significance of her grief in the context of others' experiences.
- Connection to the Buddha's teachings on suffering.

## Question 4
Why do you think Kisa Gotami understood this only the second time? In what way did the Buddha change her understanding?

**Model Answer:**  
Kisa Gotami likely understood this only the second time because her initial grief clouded her perception, making her unable to see beyond her own suffering. The Buddha's challenge to find mustard seeds from a house without death forced her to confront the reality of loss in others' lives, which ultimately led to her enlightenment about the nature of grief.

**Key Points:**
- Impact of initial grief on Kisa's understanding.
- The Buddha's method of teaching through a practical challenge.
- The shift from selfish grief to collective understanding.

## Question 5
How do you usually understand the idea of ‘selfishness’? Do you agree with Kisa Gotami that she was being ‘selfish in her grief’?

**Model Answer:**  
Selfishness is often understood as prioritizing one's own needs or feelings over others, typically at the expense of empathy. I agree with Kisa Gotami's realization that her grief was selfish initially, as she was unable to acknowledge that others also suffer from loss. This understanding highlights the importance of recognizing shared human experiences in times of sorrow.

**Key Points:**
- Definition of selfishness in the context of grief.
- Kisa's initial focus on her own loss.
- The importance of empathy and shared experiences in grief.
